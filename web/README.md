## Demo

You can view a fully working demo at [demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app](https://demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app/).

## Deploy to Vercel

Vercel deployment will guide you through creating a Supabase account and project.

After installation of the Supabase integration, all relevant environment variables will be assigned to the project so the deployment is fully functioning.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&project-name=nextjs-with-supabase&repository-name=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-title=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-description=This+starter+configures+Supabase+Auth+to+use+cookies%2C+making+the+user%27s+session+available+throughout+the+entire+Next.js+app+-+Client+Components%2C+Server+Components%2C+Route+Handlers%2C+Server+Actions+and+Middleware.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2F&external-id=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2Fopengraph-image.png)

The above will also clone the Starter kit to your GitHub, you can clone that locally and develop locally.

If you wish to just develop locally and not deploy to Vercel, [follow the steps below](#clone-and-run-locally).

## Clone and run locally

1. You'll first need a Supabase project which can be made [via the Supabase dashboard](https://database.new)

2. Create a Next.js app using the Supabase Starter template npx command

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

   ```bash
   yarn create next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

   ```bash
   pnpm create next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

3. Use `cd` to change into the app's directory

   ```bash
   cd with-supabase-app
   ```

4. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT URL]
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT API ANON KEY]
   ```

   Both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` can be found in [your Supabase project's API settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true)

   > Note: No additional environment variables are needed for GitHub OAuth as it's configured directly in the Supabase dashboard.

5. You can now run the Next.js local development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The starter kit should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

## GitHub OAuth Setup

To enable GitHub login/signup functionality, follow these steps:

1. Go to your [Supabase project dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers)

2. Navigate to **Authentication** > **Providers** in the sidebar

3. Find **GitHub** in the list of providers and click on it

4. Enable GitHub authentication by toggling the switch

5. You'll need to create a GitHub OAuth application:

   - Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
   - Click **New OAuth App**
   - Fill in the application details:
     - **Application name**: Your app name
     - **Homepage URL**: Your app URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` for development)
     - **Authorization callback URL**:
       - For production: `https://[YOUR_PROJECT_REF].supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
       - For local development: `http://localhost:54321/auth/v1/callback` (if using Supabase CLI)
   - Click **Register application**
   - Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

6. Back in your Supabase dashboard, enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** in the GitHub provider settings

7. Save the configuration

The GitHub login button will now appear on the login page.

> Note: Make sure to add your domain to the authorized redirect URIs in both GitHub OAuth App settings and Supabase project settings when deploying to production.

## Authentication Features

This starter kit now supports **GitHub OAuth only**. The traditional email/password authentication has been removed, providing a streamlined login experience with:

- Single-click GitHub OAuth login
- Automatic account creation for new GitHub users
- No password management required
- Simplified user experience

6. This template comes with the default shadcn/ui style initialized. If you instead want other ui.shadcn styles, delete `components.json` and [re-install shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next)

> Check out [the docs for Local Development](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/local-development) to also run Supabase locally.
